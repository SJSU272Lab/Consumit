###Problem:

While global leaders struggle to figure out how to nourish 9 billion people, a challenge anytime but especially in a warming world, nearly 40% of the food is wasted – spoiled before anyone can eat it. Every year, the average person produces nearly 475 pounds of food waste. That adds up to a whopping 70+ million tons, making it the third largest component by weight in our landfills. And with today’s busy schedules, people tend to forget what food products they have stocked back at home. Leaders are dealing with this issue in various ways  like promoting left-over food management. But we aim to target this issue at the root level by avoiding the waste itself.

###Solution:

Since charity begins at home, we aim to reduce the food wastage by helping the family members in being cognizant of the food stocked at their place. We aim to develop an app that will 
keep track the food items bought, tracking their expiry dates and reminding the family members, through notifications, about the food stock they should consume within time to avoid wastage. 

###Future Enhancements:

Suppose our app notifies a family that tomatoes would be perished in next 2 days. If family know they won’t be cooking for next 2 days then they can notify NGO. This is more common with the working people as with their busy schedules, they tend to forget what food products they have stocked. In future enhancement, we want to integrate NGO available in that area with the app to get food donation reaching nearest destination.
